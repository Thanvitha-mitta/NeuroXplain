## 🌟 Features

- **Multi-class Classification**: Detects 4 different brain conditions
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit application
- **Grad-CAM Visualization**: Explainable AI with heatmap overlays
- **PDF Report Generation**: Professional medical reports with QR codes
- **Real-time Predictions**: Fast inference with confidence scores
- **Model Training Pipeline**: Complete training and evaluation setup

## 📊 Dataset

The system is trained on a comprehensive brain MRI dataset with the following structure:

```
dataset/
├── Training/
│   ├── glioma/        (1,321 images)
│   ├── meningioma/    (1,339 images)
│   ├── notumor/       (1,595 images)
│   └── pituitary/     (1,457 images)
└── Testing/
    ├── glioma/        (300 images)
    ├── meningioma/    (306 images)
    ├── notumor/       (405 images)
    └── pituitary/     (300 images)
```

**Total Dataset**: ~7,000+ brain MRI images across 4 classes

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:

- **Input Layer**: 150x150x3 RGB images
- **Convolutional Layers**:
  - Conv2D(32) → MaxPooling2D
  - Conv2D(64) → MaxPooling2D
  - Conv2D(128) → MaxPooling2D
- **Dense Layers**:
  - Dense(128) with ReLU activation
  - Dropout(0.5) for regularization
  - Dense(4) with Softmax activation (4 classes)
